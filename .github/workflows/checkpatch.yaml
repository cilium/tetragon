    # Skip the workflow for Renovate PRs.
    # One issue checkpatch checks is whether the commit subject is not too long. Renovate commits tend to have long
    # subjects for a reason (e.g. including the digest). Other checkpatch checks are either ignored or relevant only
    # for BPF code, so it's fine to skip the entire workflow for Renovate PRs. If there are more checks added then we
    # should revisit it (and maybe update cilium-checkpatch).
