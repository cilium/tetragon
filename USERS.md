Who is using Tetragon?
====================

Tetragon is growing in adoption, and sharing experiences and learning from other users is essential for the continued growth of the project and the community. People often want to know if product/platform X has integrated Tetragon. Tetragon is a sub-project under Cilium, and users can get in touch via the Tetragon channel on [Cilium Slack community](https://cilium.herokuapp.com/). While the Cilium Slack community allows users to get in touch, it can be challenging to find this information quickly.

This file is a directory of adopters to help identify users of individual features. The users themselves directly maintain the list.
