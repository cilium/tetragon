/*
 * Process execution is installing the new credentials and security attributes
 * related to the new exec.
 *
 * This program will check the current process credentials against the new
 * credentials that were adjusted by the capability LSM and will be applied to
 * current task part of the execve call.
 * For such case this hook must be when we are committing the new credentials
 * to the task being executed.
 * For such the hook must run after:
 *   bprm_creds_from_file()
 *   |__cap_bprm_creds_from_file() capability LSM where the bprm is properly set.
 *
 * It reads the linux_bprm->per_clear flags that are the personality flags to clear
 * when we are executing a privilged program. Normally we should check the
 * bprm->secureexec bit field if set to 1 or not. If bprm->secureexec is 1 then:
 * The AT_SECURE of auxv will have value of 1 which means executable should be treated
 * securely. Most commonly, 1 indicates that the process is executing a set-user-ID
 * or set-group-ID binary (so that its real and effective UIDs or GIDs differ
 * from one another), or that it gained capabilities by executing a binary file
 * that has capabilities (see capabilities(7)).
 * Alternatively, a nonzero value may be triggered by a Linux Security Module.
 * When this value is nonzero, the dynamic linker disables the use of certain
 * environment variables.
 *
 * However since bprm->secreexec is a bit field we have to assume and compute its
 * offset to locate it first. An alternative way is to check the brpm->per_clear
 * personality flags that will also be set if it is a privileged execution.
 *
 * After that we check the credential fields and guess which privileged execution.
 * Example: if linux_bprm->cred->{euid,egid} differ from current uid and gid
 * then this is probably a set-user-id or set-group-id execution.
