## Upgrade notes for version v1.1.2

### Helm

The default livenessProbe was changed to use a gRPC liveness probe instead of the tetra status
command.

Users can migrate to the old behavior by using a helm configuration such as:
```
   tetragon:
      livenessProbe:
         timeoutSeconds: 60
         exec:
           command:
           - tetra
           - status
           - --server-address
           - "54321"
           - --retries
           - "5"
```
