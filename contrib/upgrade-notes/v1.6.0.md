## Upgrade notes

Read the upgrade notes carefully before upgrading Tetragon.
Depending on your setup, changes listed here might require a manual intervention.

### Helm Values

* The `tetragonOperator.securityContext` field has been deprecated in favor of
  `tetragonOperator.containerSecurityContext` for clarity. The old field is
  still supported for backward compatibility but might be removed in a future
  release. Users should migrate their configurations to use the new field.

* The Tetragon Operator now defaults to running as a non-root user (UID 65532)
  for improved security. A new `tetragonOperator.runAsRoot` option has been
  added to override this behavior and run as root when needed. Set
  `tetragonOperator.runAsRoot: true` to maintain the previous root-based
  behavior if required.
