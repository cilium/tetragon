# Tetragon documentation

The documentation is a [Hugo static website](https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo)
using the [Docsy theme](https://github.com/google/docsy).

Please refer to both dedicated guides on how to install Hugo and how to tweak
Docsy but generally, to preview your work:
```shell
hugo server
```
