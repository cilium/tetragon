Tetragon is a sub-project of the Cilium project and follows the same governance
model, community processes, and contributor growth paths as Cilium. To support
contributors in gaining both privileges and responsibilities, we adopt the shared 
[Contributor Ladder](https://github.com/cilium/community/blob/main/CONTRIBUTOR-LADDER.md).
This contributor ladder defines how contributors can grow from community
participants to project maintainers, along with the expectations at each level.

Community members generally start at the first levels of the ladder and advance
as their involvement deepens. Becoming a Cilium organization member grants
additional privileges across the project ecosystem, such as the ability to
review pull requests or trigger CI runs. If you are contributing regularly to
Tetragon, we encourage you to join the 
[Tetragon team](https://github.com/cilium/community/blob/main/ladder/teams/tetragon.yaml)
to help review code and accelerate development.

Your contributions play a vital role in improving the project, and the
community is here to support you every step of the way.
