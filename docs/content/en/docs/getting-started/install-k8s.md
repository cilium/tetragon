### Create a cluster

If you donâ€™t have a Kubernetes Cluster yet, you can use the instructions below
to create a Kubernetes cluster locally or using a managed Kubernetes service:

{{< tabpane text=true >}}
{{% tab GKE %}}

The following commands create a single node Kubernetes cluster using [Google
Kubernetes Engine](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine). See
[Installing Google Cloud SDK](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/install) for
instructions on how to install `gcloud` and prepare your account.

```shell-session
export NAME="$(whoami)-$RANDOM"
export ZONE="us-west2-a"
gcloud container clusters create "${NAME}" --zone ${ZONE} --num-nodes=1
gcloud container clusters get-credentials "${NAME}" --zone ${ZONE}
```
{{% /tab %}}

{{% tab Kind %}}
Run the following command to create the Kubernetes cluster:

```shell-session
kind create cluster
```
{{% /tab %}}

{{< /tabpane >}}

### Deploy Tetragon

To install and deploy Tetragon, run the following commands:

```shell-session
helm repo add cilium https://helm.cilium.io
helm repo update
helm install tetragon cilium/tetragon -n kube-system
kubectl rollout status -n kube-system ds/tetragon -w
```

By default, Tetragon will filter kube-system events to reduce noise in the
event logs. See concepts and advanced configuration to configure these
parameters.

### Deploy demo application

To explore Tetragon its helpful to have a sample workload. Here wu use the Cilium
HTTP application, but any workload would work equally well.

To use our [demo
application](https://docs.cilium.io/en/v1.11/gettingstarted/http/#deploy-the-demo-application)

```shell-session
kubectl create -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cilium/cilium/v1.11/examples/minikube/http-sw-app.yaml
```

Before going forward, verify that all pods are up and running - it might take
several seconds for some pods until they satisfy all the dependencies:

```shell-session
kubectl get pods
```

The output should be similar to this:

```
NAME                         READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
deathstar-6c94dcc57b-7pr8c   1/1     Running   0          10s
deathstar-6c94dcc57b-px2vw   1/1     Running   0          10s
tiefighter                   1/1     Running   0          10s
xwing                        1/1     Running   0          10s
```
