  Library of Tetragon Policies

The Policy Library provides structured examples of Tetragon policies paired with relevant use cases. You can explore all documented policies, along with additional examples, in the [policy library directory](https://github.com/cilium/tetragon/tree/main/examples/policylibrary) on Github.

For further community-maintained policy examples, refer to the [policy examples directory](https://github.com/cilium/tetragon/tree/main/examples/tracingpolicy) on GitHub. These examples are valid policies provided by the community but they are not curated in terms of suitability for specific use cases or best practices.
