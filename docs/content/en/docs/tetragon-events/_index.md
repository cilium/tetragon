  Tetragon observes hooks in the kernel and generates events
---

Tetragon is able to observe critical hooks in the kernel through its sensors
and generates enriched events from them.

In the next sections we detail the available sensors with the events they
produce and we present use cases on how they can be used as a starting point.
