Understanding the intricate behavior of processes within their environments is an important requirement for many security teams. The sheer volume and complexity of modern applications and infrastructure can make detecting and responding to threats challenging.

Traditional security tooling often struggles to provide detailed, real-time information on process creation, execution, and termination, making it difficult to detect anomalies. Identifying whether processes are spawning unexpectedly, running with escalated privileges, or exiting abnormally is critical but can be cumbersome without the right tools.
