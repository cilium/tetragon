# Security Observability with eBPF

This directory contains example TracingPolicies linked from the [O'Reilly report on Security Observability with eBPF](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/security-observability-with/9781492096719/).
They can be used by those wanting to follow along in the book or as examples for users wanting to create their own TracingPolicies.
These examples were contributed by the report's authors [@sharlns](https://github.com/sharlns) and [@jedsalazar](https://github.com/jedsalazar).
