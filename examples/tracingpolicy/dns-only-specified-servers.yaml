# This tracing policy 'dns-only-specified-servers' will report attempts
# to make outbound TCP and UDP connections on port 53 to any IP address
# other than those within the specified list (127.0.0.53), and will kill
# the offending process.
#
# Description:
#  Report and block outbound TCP and UDP connections to any DNS servers
#  not in the approved list.
#
# In production, this could be used to force processes to only connect
# to approved DNS servers and to treat transgressions as evidence of
# malicious activity, resulting in the process being killed.
#
# The removal of the matchActions section would cause the policy to only
# report transgressions and not kill the offending processes, which
# might be useful in tracking poorly configured services without killing
# processes.
#
# Note: This policy uses the ip_output hook (which is hit for every
# outbound datagram) as this is required to identify matching UDP
# datagrams. This hook handles both TCP and UDP protocols so no TCP-
# specific (eg tcp_connect) hook is required in addition.
