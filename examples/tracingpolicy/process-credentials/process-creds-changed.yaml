# This 'process-creds-changed' Tracing Policy monitors calls to
# commit_creds(), override_creds() and rever_creds() when installing
# new credentials on the current task or reverting to old ones.
#
# This tracing policy is a super set of 'process-creds-installed'.
#
# The commit_creds() is a catch all:
#  * It is triggered on every execve even if semantically creds did not change
#  * When gaining new privileges or capabilities through suid exec or
#    system calls.
#  * During fork/clone and when changing the user namespace
#  * When changing other namespaces and the file system
#  * When controlling current process through prctl() system call
#  * When installing new process keyring
#  * When the kernel executes programs (umh)
#  * ...
#
# The override_creds() override the subjective creds of current process
# with new ones in order to perform privileged operations. It is used by
# kernel on behalf of processes to elevate privileges.
#
# The revert_creds() reverts the subjective creds to old ones. Usually
# used after override_creds() to discared the override creds.
#
# It works inside a pid namespace. If you want to monitor all
# processes including host ones, remove the matchNamespaces selector.
#
# Note: it can generate lot of events.
