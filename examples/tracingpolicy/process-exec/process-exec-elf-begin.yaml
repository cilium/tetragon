# This tracing policy 'process-exec-elf-begin' report the elf binary path
# being executed, just when we are switching execution to it.
#
# Description:
#  Report the file path of the new elf or flat binary that is being executed.
#
# Limitation:
#  This does not report different binary format handlers or scripts paths that
#  are being executed, but will report the final elf or flat binary, like
#  shebang (!#/bin/bash) used to handle the script.
