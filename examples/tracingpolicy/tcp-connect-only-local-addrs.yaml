# This tracing policy 'connect-only-local-addrs' will report attempts
# to make outbound TCP connections to any IP address other than those
# within the 127.0.0.0/8 CIDR, from the binary /usr/bin/curl. In
# addition it will also kill the offending curl process.
#
# Description:
#  Report and block outbound TCP connections outside loopback from
#  /usr/bin/curl.
#
# In production, this could be used to force processes to only connect
# to their side cars on their local loopback, and to treat transgressions
# as evidence of malicious activity, resulting in the process being
# killed.
