# This tracing policy 'connect-only-private-addrs' will report attempts
# to make outbound TCP connections to any IP address other than those
# within the private ranges or within the 127.0.0.0/8 CIDR, from the
# binary /usr/bin/curl. In addition it will also kill the offending
# curl process.
#
# Description:
#  Report and block outbound TCP connections outside of private
#  addresses and loopback from /usr/bin/curl.
#
# In production, this could be used to force services to only connect
# to local services and services within the local cluster. Address ranges
# can be tuned to match the environment. Transgressions will be regarded
# as evidence of malicious activity, resulting in the process being
# killed.
