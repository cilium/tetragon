# Netlify currently has a design issue internally so they cannot distinguish
# cancel jobs from failed jobs. So we disabled all notification from starting
# or cancelling/failing jobs so that non-docs related PRs are not spamed with
# Netlify notifications. See https://answers.netlify.com/t/deploy-notifications-cancel-vs-failure/37300.
