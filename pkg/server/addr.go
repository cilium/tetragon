//	unix://absolute_path for unix sockets
//	<host>:<port> for TCP (more specifically, an address that can be passed to net.Listen)
//
// Note that the client (tetra) uses https://github.com/grpc/grpc-go/blob/v1.51.0/clientconn.go#L135
// With the syntax is documented in https://github.com/grpc/grpc/blob/master/doc/naming.md. The
// server uses net.Listen. And so the two are not compatible because the client expects "ipv4" or
// "ipv6" for tcp connections.
// Hence, because we want the same string to work the same way both on the client and the server, we
// only support the two addresses above.
