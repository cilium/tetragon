    // reliable source of information. They hold various information about

    // errors and more.
    // - `execve` This event is generated by an execve syscall for a new
    // process. See procFs for the other option. A correctly formatted event
    // should either set execve or procFS (described next).
    // - `procFS` This event is generated from a proc interface. This happens
    // at Tetragon init when existing processes are being loaded into Tetragon
    // event buffer. All events should have either execve or procFS set.
    // - `truncFilename` Indicates a truncated processes filename because the
    // buffer size is too small to contain the process filename. Consider
    // increasing buffer size to avoid this.
    // - `truncArgs` Indicates truncated the processes arguments because the
    // buffer size was too small to contain all exec args. Consider increasing
    // buffer size to avoid this.
    // - `taskWalk` Primarily useful for debugging. Indicates a walked process
    // hierarchy to find a parent process in the Tetragon buffer. This may
    // happen when we did not receive an exec event for the immediate parent of
    // a process. Typically means we are looking at a fork that in turn did
    // another fork we don't currently track fork events exactly and instead
    // push an event with the original parent exec data. This flag can provide
    // this insight into the event if needed.
    // - `miss` An error flag indicating we could not find parent info in the
    // Tetragon event buffer. If this is set it should be reported to Tetragon
    // developers for debugging. Tetragon will do its best to recover
    // information about the process from available kernel data structures
    // instead of using cached info in this case. However, args will not be
    // available.
    // - `needsAUID` An internal flag for Tetragon to indicate the audit has
    // not yet been resolved. The BPF hooks look at this flag to determine if
    // probing the audit system is necessary.
    // - `errorFilename` An error flag indicating an error happened while
    // reading the filename. If this is set it should be reported to Tetragon
    // developers for debugging.
    // - `errorArgs` An error flag indicating an error happened while reading
    // the process args. If this is set it should be reported to Tetragon
    // developers for debugging
    // - `needsCWD` An internal flag for Tetragon to indicate the current
    // working directory has not yet been resolved. The Tetragon hooks look at
    // this flag to determine if probing the CWD is necessary.
    // - `noCWDSupport` Indicates that CWD is removed from the event because
    // the buffer size is too small. Consider increasing buffer size to avoid
    // this.
    // - `rootCWD` Indicates that CWD is the root directory. This is necessary
    // to inform readers the CWD is not in the event buffer and is '/' instead.
    // - `errorCWD` An error flag indicating an error occurred while reading
    // the CWD of a process. If this is set it should be reported to Tetragon
    // developers for debugging.
    // - `clone` Indicates the process issued a clone before exec*. This is the
    // general flow to exec* a new process, however its possible to replace the
    // current process with a new process by doing an exec* without a clone. In
    // this case the flag will be omitted and the same PID will be used by the
